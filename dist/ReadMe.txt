=====Installation=====

To install the plugin:

1. Open wp-admin and navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload.
2. Click Choose File, and choose the file jck-woo-show-single-variations.zip from your CodeCanyon download zip.
3. Once uploaded, click activate plugin.
4. The plugin is now installed and activated.

=====Usage=====

Currently, there are no global settings for the plugin. You can configure the variation display options on a per-variation basis.

===Choose Where your Variation will be Displayed===

When editing or adding a product variation, you can select whether to show the single variation in the catalog, search results, and filtered results. See the Image below for where these settings are found.

==Show in Search Results?==

If a user uses the WooCommerce search field to find a product by name, the variation will be displayed (if it matches the search query).

==Show in Filtered Results?==

If a customer uses the product filters in a catalog listing, the variation will be displayed (if it matches the search query).

==Show in Catalog?==

The variation will be displayed in normal catalog listings, like the homepage or a category page.

===Use a Different Title for the Product Variation===

By default, the variation will use the same title as it's parent product. You can change this by entering a new title into the Display Options - Title field. See the Image below for where these settings are found.

===Hide the Main Variable Product===

You can do this by default in WooCommerce anyway; simply set the main product visibility, found under Publish > Catalog visibility, to your requirements, and click Update or Publish.
